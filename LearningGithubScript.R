# I have Git downloaded on the desktop locally, and github is the web browser cloud
# Create a new repository in github, create a git ignore and a readme. Once a repository is created, click the green code button in the top right and find the HTTPS URL 
# Once we have everything downloaded, we create a new R project and select the option "Version Control" - this adds the "Git" tab, make sure this is there before continuing with Github 
# The version control uses the HTTPS URL from github. Paste the URL into the R prompt, and select the folder to save the project (I have created a github folder in my Duke OneDrive)


# Lets begin:
# My favorite food is burgers
# My favorite place to vacation is Pemiquid Maine
